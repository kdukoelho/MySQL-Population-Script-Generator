# Population MySQL Script Generator
## Description

This project is made to do the massive population scripts of MySQL databases. It reads a JSON named by "data.json" that contains all the desired data. At the end of the process a file called "generated_code.sql" is created (if not exists) containing the formatted MySQL code. Be careful because, if this file already exists, its contents will be overwritten.

The JSON file can be generated at www.4devs.com.br/gerador_de_pessoas
