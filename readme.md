# Population MySQL Script Generator
## Description
This project is made to do the massive and fast population scripts of MySQL databases. It reads a JSON named by "data.json" that contains all the desired data. At the end of the process a file called "generated_code.sql" is created (if not exists) containing the formatted MySQL code. Be careful because if this file already exists, its contents will be overwritten.
